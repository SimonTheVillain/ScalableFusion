 * @brief The GpuGeomStorage class
 * TODO: think about how data could be loaded onto and downloaded from from different threads.
 * (Propably you could easiliy add mutexes that block everything but that is not the nicest way)
 *
 * for the structures defined in scaleableMap it is as follows:
 * Most ideally we know that only the capture thread modifies data on the gpu and the remaining structure.
 * the render thread only needs to read it.
 *
 * For the GpuGeomStorage it is different:
 * We would have to use MUTEXes for the arrays we iterate over, or we use the mutex for every geometry structure!!!!!
 * It is the easiest solution and the only
 * one that secures that we do not duplicate data on the gpu.

	 * TOTHINK: we have to protect these pointers from beeing used too early.
	 * e.g. as they are not totally uploaded yet but the pointer is set. the renderer might want to render from that.
	 * POSSIBLE SOLUTION: protect these arrays with the pointers with mutexes but add "uploadingInProgress" booleans
	 * to tell the reading threads that there is something going on.
	 * TOTHINK2: a lot of these elements could be deleted on the cpu side.
	 * having weak_ptrs in this list would definitely help managing deleting of objects.
